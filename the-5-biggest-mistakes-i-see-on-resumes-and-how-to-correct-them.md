## Mistake 1: Typos.

> Read your resume from bottom to top: reversing the normal order helps you focus on each line in isolation. Or have someone else proofread closely for you.

## Mistake 2: Length.

> A good rule of thumb is one page of resume for every ten years of work experience.

## Mistake 3: Formatting.

> Unless you're applying for a job such as a designer or artist, your focus should be on making your resume clean and legible.

> Formatting can get garbled when moving across platforms. Saving it as a PDF is a good way to go.

## Mistake 4: Confidential information.

> The *New York Times* test is helpful here: if you wouldn't want to see it on the home page of the *NYT* with your name attached (or if your boss wouldn't!), don't put it on your resume.

## Mistake 5: Lies.

Don't Lie!

## Conclusion

> The good news is that -- precisely because most resumes have these kinds of mistakes -- avoiding them makes you stand out.
